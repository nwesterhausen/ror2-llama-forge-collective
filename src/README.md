Modpack for the Llama Forge Collective

Adds some extra survivors and QOL tweaks.

## Description

I set it up initially with the following things:

### QOL

- Detailed item descriptions (see exactly what an item does)
- Item stats (see the total value from your stack of items on hover)
- View your current stats (when pressing tab)
- Game lobby remembers what settings you used previously
- Empty chests disappear after 30s
- Chat messages when using the scanner equipment
- Chat message when you die
- Lunar Coins are shared on pickup

### Game Changes

- Small buff to warbanner
- Aegis (red item) gives armor
- Mercenary always gets return from his Expose
- Engineer mobile turret buff
- Partial metamorphosis artifact: Metamorphosis artifact can be enabled for only some players in multiplayer

### Added Artifacts

- Artifact of Conformity: disables scappers and printers
- Artifact of Shops: replaces all chests with shops
- Artifact of Genetics: adds a enemy buff system that increases stats slightly on "sucessful" versions of monsters
- Artifact of Void: brings void fields to all levels

### Added Characters

- Miner (from RoR1)
